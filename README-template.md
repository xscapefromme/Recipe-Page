## Overview

## My process
Starting framing everything through html then styling through CSS. Little stuck here and there especially with setting the fonts and appropriate font-weight and trying to get them as close as possible. Was also having trouble with the table at first as its been a while that I created a table and have so many elements with it. 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned a lot as usual when building these projects. Regainde mememory on building a table, learned to style it through mobile first then outward, learned how to utilize display: flex;, a are inline elements, to change the bullet points using the ::marker psuedo element was helpful allowing full width of 100% and just overall better organizational skills. 





### Continued development

Still need a lot more practice, with mobile responsiveness and overall just getting comfortable with media queries, embeded font-family still having a little trouble with that. Those were the main things I need to continue to work on.
